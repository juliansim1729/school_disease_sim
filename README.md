# school_disease_sim

A highly customizable simulation of the spread of an infectious disease at a secondary school (based off typical class scheduling systems). This work was completed as part of an undergraduate thesis for the Schreyer Honors College at the Pennsylvania State University, and the full thesis can be viewed (here)[https://honors.libraries.psu.edu/catalog/8733jzs6321].

Currently, this repository is being redesigned and rebuilt from a pre-existing directory located (here)[https://github.com/juliansim1729/EpiModelExpansion] to be cleaner & a solid portfolio piece.
